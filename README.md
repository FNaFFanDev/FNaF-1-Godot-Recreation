# FNaF-1-Godot-Recreation
The repo for my godot recreation of the first FNaF game. If you find any bugs, either fix them and add them to the repo or submit it so that I can fix it.
The game is complete, only missing a few sounds. I'm way too burned out to add the rest of the sounds in, so I might do so at a later date, if none of you would like to do it.

IMPORTANT:
Please download the FNaF 1 texture dump here https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalFNaF/comments/7i6jss/mega_dump/ as well as the audio dump. Extract both files and rename the texture dump folder to just "FNaF 1" and put the audio folder inside of it. Then put the FNaF 1 folder in the project folder.
Godot is a path sensitive engine, so it will not load textures if they aren't in the same directory I put them in while programming.
Have fun learning!
